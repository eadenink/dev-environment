# My development environment

> This is my dev environment. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Properly designed designed development environment is crucial part of your workflow that will help you be more productive, write applications faster, become a real 10x developer and bla bla bla... To be honest, I do mine because it's helluva fun, combining all these little crumbles into a beautiful pile of features that somehow works(or don't). My configuration is based on combination of neovim, tmux and their plugins to minimize using of a mouse in my workflow, it helps to write code faster and spend less time and focus on dragging cursor from one end of screen to another, everything you need is under tips of your fingers. Besides that, I use ghostty as my tty and zsh combined with starship as my shell. All this setup may seem pretty complicated at the start but it's pretty simple and easy to maintain. You can try it yourself and reach me out if you liked it or not!
